Reader Sorting

Flask application written to assist in performing a specific type of image quality preference study, wherein radiologists/other staff members rank 5 images from best to worst. The application is written to expedite the process, ideally allowing the sorting to be completed quickly and therefore a reasonably large dataset to be compiled.

The main purposes of this application are:

 - Evaluating image quality metrics to assess how well they adhere to radiologist preference
 - Expediting image quality reviews, such as multi-device reviews

Statistical analysis functions and plotting functions are included, but not integrated.
